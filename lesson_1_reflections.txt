How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

It showed me the bug

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It will show me previous mistakes
    I've made.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    It mitigates human error.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Files stored in Git are usually
    related.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    You can use git log to see all
    one's history of commits and 
    git diff to see changes made
    between commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I will know I easily can revert
    to the previous code.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Incessantly. (Maybe thats an exageration).
